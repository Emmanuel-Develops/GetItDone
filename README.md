# Minimalistic Todo App


## <b>Overview</b>
This is a very simple and minimalist todo app. It uses [ejs](https://ejs.co/) for its layout and styling and [expressjs](https://expressjs.com/), a popular Nodejs framework for its backend functionality.


## <b>LIVE LINK<b>
[Test](http://karenlist.herokuapp.com/) out the app.

## <b>Features</b>
- The app renders the current date at the top of the todolist.
- Add a list of your todos to be completed
- Create separate todo categories for tasks to be completed. Currently, there is support for main tasks, which can be found on the homepage, for work tasks (/work) and miscellaneous tasks(/miscellaneous).
- Easily mark off completed tasks.
- Delete tasks that have been completed or no longer fit into the agenda for that day.
